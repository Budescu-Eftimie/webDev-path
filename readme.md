# My personal webDev learning path

## Why i made this repository ?

First of all , a few months have passed already since i started to learn by myself, and while i know now more then i did at the verry i feel like my progress is not optimal, i could do better and also i found that self-learning is difficult without accountability and structure.
So , the reasons behind this repo is to help me become more organized put some code and exercises in here that i could practice over and over again , test myself, acquiring a programer/developer mindset, track my progress and to help me pinpoint areas of improvement.
